All discount types. WordPress Customizer supported.

== Description ==

This plugin helps you  quickly set discounts and pricing rules for your WooCommerce store.

Set up any kind of discount or dynamic pricing you like, and activate/deactivate rules as needed.

Configure fixed dollar amount adjustments, percentage adjustments, or set fixed price for the product or group of products.

Also supports role-based prices & bulk pricing. **Bulk tables can be designed with Customizer.** You should setup bulk rule for category/product at first and enable "Show Bulk Table" at tab "Settings".

= Some Examples  = 

* Category-level discounts - discount products and provide free shipping
* Buy 4(or more) items on Friday and get 20% off 
* Buy product X and get product Y for free - immediately added and visible in cart
* Buy a package -  discount it (each item separately), and also get a free product
* Apply bulk discount for selected items, available only to wholesale buyers
* Give a 10% discount to all "Accessories"(Category) if a product X is present in the cart

Check more examples [on our website](https://algolplus.com/plugins/woocommerce-pricing-rules-examples/).

= One pricing rule can  =
* Filter cart items by products, categories, tags or custom fields
* Modify price for each product separately 
* Or set total price for whole set
* Apply cart discounts and fees
* Add free products on fly
* Use tables to get bulk rates
* Validate conditions for cart items, user roles or dates
* Track limits (only "max usage" supported currently)

= Interface settings = 
* Show/hide original prices 
* Show/hide badge "On Sale"
* Show/hide bulk discount table on the product page
* Set rule for  products which already on sale
* and much more ...

[Pro version](https://algolplus.com/plugins/downloads/advanced-dynamic-pricing-woocommerce-pro/) can [adjust product price onfly](https://algolplus.com/plugins/pro-features-in-action/), adds **exclusive rules, extra conditions, a lot of settings, and statistics** (which rules really work, which products are involved and how much does it cost for you).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Compatibility with my theme/plugin =
Free and pro versions use same core, so you can test it using free version. [Please, visit the link to see detailed reply](https://algolplus.com/plugins/pricing-plugin-compatibility/)
= How to allow customer to select free product =
You should create package rule and set zero price for free product. [Please, check 3rd example](https://algolplus.com/plugins/dynamic-pricing-examples-package-pricing/)
= How to customize bulk tables =
You should copy necessary files from folder “templates” to folder “advanced-dynamic-pricing-for-woocommerce” (create it in active theme)
= The rules are not applied to orders if I use button "Add order" (>WooCommerce>Orders) =
This form adds new order directly to the database. But all pricing plugins work with cart items. Use our plugin [Phone Orders](https://wordpress.org/plugins/phone-orders-for-woocommerce/) to add backend orders.
= I need custom cart condition =
You should be PHP programmer to do it. [Please, review sample addon and adapt it for your needs](https://algolplus.com/plugins/program-custom-condition/)
